# Bruteforce Login Detection

What is a Login Brute-Force Attack?


A brute-force attack is when an attacker:

      Tries many username/password combinations

      Repeats login attempts very fast

      Hopes to guess the correct credentials

      Monitors login attempts

      Identifies suspicious behavior

      Blocks or limits attackers
